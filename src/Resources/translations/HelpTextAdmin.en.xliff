                    <p>A page is a key building block for the website. On a page you can add or change your content and its position in the layout. Under &quot;Pages&quot; in the CMS you see a list of all your pages. On top of the list you can filter and search pages. There is also a prominent button for adding new Pages. On the bottom of the list you find bulk actions to apply quick changes to multiple pages at once.</p>

                    <h2>List of pages</h2>

                    <p>The list of pages offers different information or actions. Every new row describes a different page. The following list explains the columns from left to right.</p>

                    <p><strong>Check Boxes</strong><br />
                    You can select single <s>pages</s> or multiple pages by checking or unchecking the check boxes on the left <s>to</s> side of every page. The first checkbox on the top left will check or uncheck all of the listed pages. After you selected the pages you want, you can choose an action from the dropdown menu at the bottom of the list. By clicking &quot;OK&quot; you will execute the action for all the checked pages.</p>

                    <p><strong>Page Name</strong><br />
                    A column that shows the page name. If you click on the name you will go directly to the edit mode.</p>

                    <p><strong>Page Status</strong><br />
                    On the right side of the page name you see the status of page. It can be set to draft, review or published.</p>

                    <p><strong>URL</strong><br />
                    This column shows the URL of the page. The URL excludes your domain name in favor of a shorter version.</p>

                    <p><strong>Edit Button</strong><br />
                    The edit button has a pencil icon. Click to edit the content and the configuration of the page.</p>

                    <p><strong>Delete Button</strong><br />
                    The delete button has a trashcan icon. Click it to delete a page you no longer want to use.</p>

                    <h2>Filter pages</h2>

                    <p>The page list can be filtered by selecting one or more of the offered parameters. You can change these parameters and click on the &quot;Filter&quot; button to find pages that match your filters. If you click on &quot;Clear&quot; the filters will be reset. By Clicking on &quot;More filter options&quot; all the available options for filtering will be shown.</p>

                    <p><strong>Language</strong><br />
                    Change between different languages, you can only view pages in one language at a time</p>

                    <p><strong>Page Name</strong><br />
                    Find a specific page by name or find multiple pages with a part of the page name</p>

                    <p><strong>URL</strong><br />
                    Find a page or multiple pages with a specific part of the URL</p>

                 <p>Begin by clicking the &quot;+ Add Page&quot; button in the &quot;Pages&quot; section of the CMS. All fields marked with &quot;*&quot; are mandatory, the others are optional. The following list explains all fields.</p>

                 <h2>New page fields</h2>

                 <p><strong>Language</strong><br />
                 Each page belongs to one language. You can copy this page into another language at a later stage, or connect the page to an existing page in another language in order to create a link connecting single pages in the different languages.</p>

                 <p><strong>Page Name</strong><br />
                 The page name is for your internal use and not shown on the website</p>

                 <p><strong>Parent Page</strong><br />
                 If another page is related to this one (e.g. About Us and Contact), the pages can be connected. This will be shown in the list view of the Pages as well in the URL: e.g. http://wwww.site.com/about_us/contact instead of http://wwww.site.com/contact</p>

                 <p><strong>URL</strong><br />
                 Only the last part of the URL has to be entered. If there one or more parent pages exist, they will be automatically added as a prefix to the URL. No special characters can be used in an URL. Those will be automatically filtered out. Above the input field you can preview the processed URL</p>

                 <p><strong>Visibility</strong><br />
                 A page can be either public and be seen by everyone or it is protected, meaning that the user must be logged in to view the page.</p>

                 <p><strong>Page Layout</strong><br />
                 Choose the layout that fits your page the best. A selection of predefined layout will be displayed with a thumbnail image. The Layout will dictate what content can be placed where on the page.</p>

                 <p><strong>Meta Title</strong><br />
                 This title is shown in the title of the browser and searched by search engines</p>

                 <p><strong>Meta Keywords</strong><br />
                 Keywords are not shown on the page, but only in the source code of the page. Those are needed by google and other search engines to index your page</p>

                 <p><strong>Meta Description</strong><br />
                 As with the keywords above, the meta description is only visible in the source code. Search engines also use it.</p>

                 <p>As soon as you save the form, the page is saved to the database and you switch to the editing view.</p>

          <p>The Edit Form has multiple areas. Below the page title you see the content area with one or more layout containers. On the right side you find additional information and actions for the page.</p>

          <h2>Content area</h2>

          <p>In the content area below the page title you see the different layout containers (e.g. header, main-content, left column etc.). For each layout container, multiple content blocks can be assigned. Those blocks can be either text or galleries (or other predefined content types). New blocks can be created by clicking on the + icon. Existing blocks can be deleted (Trash icon), edited (Pen icon) or moved to another position (arrows).</p>

          <h2>Publishing Status</h2>

          <p>A page can be in a Draft or Published state. The last published state is what the normal user will see in the frontend, the draft state is only visible for users of the admin area of the CMS. Pages in the Draft state can also be marked for review, this is not so much as a state as a flag to let everyone know that the page is ready to be published following a review. IMPORTANT, only published pages are viewable to the general public.</p>

          <p><strong>Draft</strong><br />
          As soon a page is created or something on the page is edited, the status is set to &quot;Draft&quot;. If all the changes are correct, the status should be changed to &quot;Review&quot; or &quot;Published&quot;. If necessary, say you want to return to the last &quot;Published&quot; Version, you can click &quot;Discard Draft&quot; on the right side.</p>

          <p><strong>Review</strong><br />
          Someone has made changes to the page, and the page is ready for publication (but is not yet published). Before the page is published, the changes should be reviewed. Check the &quot;Review&quot; box to add the Page to a review list for a publisher. Overall it is it optional to use this status, it just helps create a proper editor/publisher workflow.</p>

          <p><strong>Published</strong><br />
          If all the changes are correct (by a review), the status can be changed to &quot;Published&quot;. All changes will now be publicly visible.</p>

          <h2>Translations</h2>

          <p>If this page exists in another language, a link to this page can be created. As an alternative option, the page can be copied to another language for a quicker start. Under translation you can manage all language associations.</p>

          <h2>Menu Connections</h2>

          <p>A page can be present in different menus. Maybe you want your &ldquo;contact&rdquo; page in the main menu, but also in the footer menu. Under menu connections you can manage all menu entries as well as create new ones.</p>

          <h2>Settings &amp; SEO</h2>

          <p>Here you find the same fields as used when creating a page. You can edit the page name (by clicking on the pen icon), the URL, the page visibility, the page layout and other page meta settings.</p>

          <h2>Email Address Encryption</h2>

          <p>If you use email addresses in the text editor, please make sure to create a link for every email address (click chain symbol, choose Email as Link-Type). The cms will encrypt these email addresses automatically and they will not be readable by spam robots.

                    <p>A menu provides a navigation to make your content easily accessible by others. Each menu is represented by a tab, the selected menu is highlighted. Below the highlighted menu you will see all the options and the list of menu items. The menu item list displays information about each menu point and offers the functions to move (reorder), edit and delete each point. On top of the tabs you can filter the menus by language.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding menus</h2>

                    <p><strong>Menu</strong><br />
                    A menu is a list of pages or links for navigating the content on your website. A website can have multiple menus, for example a &quot;main menu&quot; and a &quot;secondary menu&quot;. You can add a new menu with the &quot;+&quot; tab on the right side of the menu tab navigation (most users do not have the permission to add or delete menus).</span></p>

                    <p><strong>Menu Item</strong><br />
                    A menu item consists of a name and a page or a link (URL). Menu items can be organized hierarchically, drag and drop them to create the structure you like. You can build multiple levels of menu items and nest them freely. The URL does not change if you move a</span><span style="line-height:1.6em"> menu item to another place in your menu tree (the URL</span><span style="line-height:1.6em"> is defined by the URL of the page, or the URL entered in the external/internal URL setting of the menu item).</p>

                    <p><strong>Menu Item Name</strong><br />
                    The Name of a menu item can be any string of your choice. If you like you can use the same term as for the page name it links to, but you can also name it anything else. Choose a name, which describes the content well, and also use terms which will aid google and other search engines to locate your pages.</p>

                    <p><strong>Menu Item Link</strong><br />
                    A menu item links to a page or to a custom external/internal URL. Different menu items can link to the same page or the same URL.</p>

                    <p><strong>Menu Language</strong><br />
                    A menu belongs to the selected language only. Thus every language has it's own menus. This allows you to have a separate menu tree in each language.</p>

                    <p><strong>Name</strong><br />
                    The name is mandatory and will be used for your menu item. Use a name that describes your content best.</p>

                    <p><strong>Page</strong><br />
                    The page is not mandatory. You can select any existing page to use as the URL for the menu item. If you do not select a page, you must enter either an external or an internal URL</p>

                    <p><strong>External URL</strong><br />
                    The external URL is not mandatory. Instead of selecting a page you can add any URL as long as provide the whole URL e.g. http://www.initcms.com. You need this to create an absolute link to another site.</p>

                    <p><strong>Internal URL</strong><br />
                    The internal URL is not mandatory. Instead of selecting a page or an external URL you can add an internal URL. An internal URL contains everything after the top level domain e.g. /news/new-products. You need this to create relative links to your own site.</p>

                    <p><strong>+ Options</strong><br />
                    Click Options to get the following additional possibilities.</p>

                    Use the visibility setting to make the menu item public available or only in the secured area.</p>

                    <p><strong>Link Target</strong><br />
                    Define the target if you don&#39;t want that the page opens in the same window. There are multiple options to choose from.</p>

                    <p><strong>Link Class</strong><br />
                    The link class your enter here will be added as a CSS styling option.</p>

                    <p><strong>Link Relation</strong><br />
                    This setting adds the &ldquo;rel&rdquo; attribute to your link. This can be useful when creating links which open a lightbox image gallery for example, or to trigger other javascript functionality.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hide Menu Item</strong><br />
                    If you want to hide the menu item, but still want to work it normally otherwise check this box. For example, you want a particular navigation point to be highlighted as the active parent of the search results page, but do not wish to have a link visible in the menu to the search results page, then this would be the right choice for you.</p>

                    <p>The media section helps you to manage media files like images, videos and other files conveniently. On the top of the media site you can filter the media by name or you have the additional option to filter by media tags. The different tabs show the media context (see below), just choose &quot;Default&quot; if you have no other information. The type helps you to see all files, only images, only files or only videos. After the type you have an &quot;+ Add Item&quot; Button which is also covered by this help. Finally you see a list of your media files according to all your above settings and you can perform some actions on every item.</p>

                    <h2>Media Context</h2>

                    <p>A media context is a way to group specific media types together. Media contexts are defined in the site configuration; you can restrict which types of media are allowed in each context, and, in the case of images, define what sizes the images should be cropped to. This allows great control of you media, and prevents users uploading the wrong media type as well as keeping images in the correct format.</p>

                    <p>E.g. You need to maintain product images as well as images for news articles; your webmaster must configure two media contexts, each one defining the various image sizes (thumbnail, small, medium etc). as well as define what files will be allowed.</p>

                    <h2>Media Formats</h2>

                    <p>This refers to the format or type of media such e.g.</p>

                    <ul>
                    	<li>Image (.jpg, .png)</li>
                    	<li>PDF documents (.pdf)</li>
                    	<li>Video (h246, mpeg)</li>
                    	<li>Audio (.mp3)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Your Webmaster will setup these for you.</p>

                    <p>The media gallery helps to present a collection of media items (typically images) on a page. You may add media via the media manager first, and then select them when creating a gallery, or you can upload media during the gallery creation process.</p>

                    <p>Galleries can later be incorporated on a page by inserting a content block of the type &ldquo;Gallery&rdquo;.</p>

                    <h2>Add a gallery</h2>

                    <p>When you add a gallery you can also add media in the same step, so you don&#39;t have to go forth and back. The gallery consists of the following fields.</p>

                    <p>A user can login into the system with a username/email and a password. Users have different rights to interact with the website, e.g. an admin can create and publish new pages, but an extranet user could be restricted to have only read access for a certain webpage. The user can be given specific roles (permissions) by being assigned to one or more user groups. Read the groups help to get a more detailed understanding of user permissions.</p>

                    <h2>List of users</h2>

                    <p>The list of users offers an overview of information or actions. Every new row describes a new user. The following list explains the columns from left to right.</p>

                    <p><strong>Username</strong><br />
                    The name of the user. The name will be used to login into the system.</p>

                    <p><strong>Email Address</strong><br />
                    An email address of the user. This will be used to notify the user if she/he lost her/his password.</p>

                    <p><strong>Groups</strong><br />
                    A list of groups that this user belongs to. A group contains one or more roles, so that it is easy to add the right permission to your users.</p>

                    <p><strong>Enabled</strong><br />
                    This signalizes if the user account is enabled (activated) or not. Only enabled users can log into the system.</p>

                    <p><strong>Impersonate User</strong><br />
                    This is a feature to login quickly as the chosen user, just by clicking on the icon. This is useful for customer support because you see the same thing as this user does. You must have special rights to impersonate as another user.</p>

                    <p><strong>Edit Button</strong><br />
                    The edit button has a pencil icon. Click to edit the user details.</p>

                    <p><strong>Delete Button</strong><br />
                    The delete button has a trashcan icon. Click it to delete a user completely.</p>

                    <h2>Filter users</h2>

                    <p>The list of users can be filtered with several parameters. You can change these parameters and click on the &quot;Filter&quot; button to find users that match your filters. If you click on &quot;Clear&quot; the filters will be reset. By Clicking on &quot;More filter options&quot; all the available options for filtering will be shown.</p>

                    <p><strong>Username</strong><br />
                    The first filter searches for a username that matches your entry.</p>

                    <p><strong>Locked</strong><br />
                    Sort which users accounts have been locked. A user can be locked, which means locked out of the application. This may be implemented for security reasons.</p>

                    <p><strong>Email Address</strong><br />
                    Enter an email address or a part of it to find the corresponding users.</p>

                    <p><strong>Groups</strong><br />
                    Select a group name to include or exclude for the search. The result filters the users additionally by groups.</p>

                    <h2>Add a new user</h2>

                    <p>To add a new user, start by clicking the &quot;+ Add User&quot; button. You will then see a form with a lot of data fields, don&#39;t worry only the following fields are mandatory.</p>

                    <p><strong>Username</strong><br />
                    The name of the user used for login.</p>

                    <p><strong>Email Address</strong><br />
                    The email address of the user, used for contact and notifications.</p>

                    <p><strong>Password</strong><br />
                    The password field is only mandatory when creating a user (this may vary depending on the setup for your specific website).</p>

                    <p>The user has a lot of additional fields like groups, roles,  and some security related fields. Just use the ones you want and leave the other empty.</p>

                     <p>A &quot;role&quot; allows a user to carry out a specific action, for example, a user that has the role &quot;ROLE_SONATA_ADMIN&quot; can log into the back end of the application, a user that has the role &quot;ROLE_NETWORKING_INIT_CMS_PAGE_ADMIN_PAGE_EDITOR&quot;, is allowed to create pages, and delete his/her own pages&quot;.</p>

                     <p>By assigning a user group specific roles, you need only care later about assigning a user the correct user groups, rather than assigning single roles to each and every user.

                <p>In order for a user to be able to use the backend you will need to assign the role &#39;ROLE_SONATA_ADMIN&#39;</p>

                <p>The role &#39;ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH&#39; allows the user, if they have access to the user admin area, to impersonate another user to see what they would see.</p>

                <p>Only super admin users can select the role ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN.</p>

                <p>After you have finished configuring your group you can:</p>
