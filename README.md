NetworkingInitCmsBundle [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/networking/init-cms-bundle.png?branch=2.5)](https://travis-ci.org/networking/init-cms-bundle)
======================
Welcome to the networking init cms bundle

The InitCmsBundle is a small flexible cms core based on symfony 2 which can be used as a standalone CMS or integrated into
any existing symfony 2 project.

The main features are:
- Page manager with draft and published states, as well as public or protected (login only) pages, and customised URLs
- Menu manager to organise multiple menu bars
- Media manager and gallery manager
- User manager with ACL access control
- Help page manager

Other Features:
- Integrate your own twig templates
- Create your own content types
- Based on the SonataAdminBundle so you can easily create your own admin modules

The project is being developed by the small hard working team at [net working AG][1] in Zürich.

If you would like to get up and running with a CMS in a symfony 2
application you can either install this bundle in an  existing project
or download and install the [networking init CMS sandbox][2]

The following links should get you started with a running cms. We are working hard to provide you with more documentation and examples, but in the meant time have a look at the following pages.
